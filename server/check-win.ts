// after receiving the player move server-side, should do the following:
// • Check to see if new move created at least 4 in a row (won game)
// • check all groupings adjacent to the new-move-piece to see if player color appears in a row of 4
// • If move resulted in win, return locations of winning adjacent pieces (ideally could be more than 4, but 4 is sufficient) so they can he highlighted client-side
// • If not, then allow other player to make move (allow them to ping server to see it's their turn)
// • After move is made and server-side state is updated, this algorithm should be run to check for the win
// • move color, and position (column, row) need to be passed into this algorithm

import { resourceLimits } from "worker_threads";
import { Board } from "../types";


// Questions
//  1. Should this be done on the server or client? (cheaper to do on client, cleaner to do on the server since that's where we're maintaining state) - opting for server
//  2. Do we need to highlight winning adjacent pieces? Should we highlight all pieces if it's more than 4 in a row? - might be easiest to highlight entire row / column / diagonal
//  3. Decided not to just list all winning combos and check against that because that seemed inefficient, but was that a mistake?


//mock for testing


// types (should these all be moved to '../types/index.ts' ?)
